Point
=====

``Point``s are coordinates in 3-dimensional space. They can be moved in 3D space 
and distances can be measured between different ``Point``s. They are used to 
define ``Polygon``s and other objects.


Parameters/Attributes
---------------------

x
  Coordinate associated with east/west direction

y 
  Coordinate associated with north/south direction

z
  Coordinate associated with elevation


Examples
--------

Moving ``Point``s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. codeblock:: python

    >>> p1 = Point(0, 0)
    >>> p1.move(2, 4)
    >>> p1
    Point(2, 4, 0)

Measuring distances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. codeblock:: python

    >>> p1 = Point(0, 0)
    >>> p2 = Point(3, 4)
    >>> p2.distance_from(p1)
    5
