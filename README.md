An open-source object library for advanced design and construction.

## Introduction

What if houses, rooms, and doors could be represented as data objects? We
could program these objects to interact the same way they do in the real
world. Then, we could automate the design process so that these objects are
procedurally generated and self-optimized to maximize cost-efficiency,
sustainability, and quality of life.

reBuildingCode (RBC) is a project set out to do just that by applying
tried-and-true [object-oriented programming](/docs/oop.md) methods to
architectural and construction concepts.

See how we can build floor plans with Python [here](/docs/intro.md).

## Contributing

RBC is a perfect project for architects and engineers who are curious about
coding. Python is a highly readable programming language and is very easy to
pick up and learn. This project is also great for software engineers who want
to build applications and tools for the construction industry.
